# CISC3160-Lab5
A repository with some old code as well as a new version of that old code.

The folder OldCode contains my unedited first major Java programming assignment.
It is a program that optimally breaks up an amount of money into bills.

The folder NewCode contains my updated version of the program.
It is in Python and adds in a feature where it breaks up coins as well.

There is also a word document which is a relection on the assignment.
